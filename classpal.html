      <h3>ClassPal:An interactive doubt clearance application for classroom</h3>
	  <h6>Project Guide:Keyur Sorathia</br>
      Duration:Aug 2012-Nov 2012</br>
	  Type: Team Project(2 Members)</br>
      Contribution:User Research, Focus Groups, Survey Design, Ideation and Analysis, Wireframes and High Fidelity Prototypes</br></br></h6>
	  <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>In this project, we developed an Interactive doubt posting/clearance portal to enhance the learning experience 
	  for a lecture based classroom.  In many ways, the portal mirrors students’ lives outside of school, where they 
	  communicate with friends via their cell phones or computers that interconnect with a slew of gadgets, participate
	  in online social networks, enjoy gaming devices that respond instantaneously to their physical movements.
	  The observations and primary user research/analysis were done within the premises of our institute, IIT Guwahati.
	  The project got selected for publication in Journal Design For All March Edition 2013</p></br>

	  
	  <h5>Project Journey</h5></br>
	  <h6>1 Research Phase</h6></br>
      <p>The strategy followed for research was divided into two phases. 
	     First to get a wide range of general opinion on the context, 
	     we carried out surveys for a large group of people. Second phase was done to get the in depth knowledge
	     of the matter and included activities like observations, user interviews and expert interviews</p></br>

		
	  <h6><b>a.Observation and Survey</h6></b></br>
      <p>We conducted observation sessions in two types of classrooms to see the activities of students and teachers. 
	  Techniques like Shadowing, and Fly on the wall were used to observe and record behavior of students without 
	  interfering in their activities. A survey was  also done ,firstly to identify the personality trait of a student 
	  and secondly a few opinion questions to know about their problems with the existing methods of teaching and interaction in class.</p></br></br>

	  <h6><b>b.User Interview and Focus Group</h6></b></br>

	  
      <p>Having done the analysis of the scores in the personality questionnaire, 
	  we picked a sample size of 8 people who reflected the extreme and moderate 
	  personality types for getting to know the different perspectives and experience of lecture
	  based classroom learning with the main focus on doubt clearance in a room.As a part of carrying the research,
	  we interviewed a few of the very experienced professors at IITG to know their side of the context with interactivity in a classroom..</p></b>

	  <h6><b>2. Analysis and Ideation</b></h6></br>
      <p>There are four main components, individual devices for students, the central control for instructor, 
	  the main operating system or the host and the web. The system shows interactions that would occur in a 
	  classroom equipped with the proposed concept .Each individual device is a part of the larger host system 
	  with a governing Operating System. On the larger display is the feedback from this operating system. 
	  Communications can occur between any of the devices within the confines of the host(classroom) and 
	  the display is a flexible media to be set by the instructor. Information to and fro the web can be transferred too.</p></br></br>

	  <h6><b>3 .Prototyping</b></h6></br>
      <h6><i>Possible Features for our  Proposed system</i></h6></br>
      <p>A new system for an interactive classroom experience with the assumption that each individual will have a handled device (Aakash Tablet) .
	    The student can use it for a rich experience of learning by accessing various features like :</br></br>
        →Doubt clearance among peers during a live classroom or lecture</br>
        →Doubt clearance by professors (admin of the system)during a lecture or in the end of a lecture</br>
        →Promotion of doubt on the basis of no of students  having the same doubt(liking a doubt)</br>
        →Answers provided for a doubt by the portal from the content provided by professor in form of E-books,lectures etc.</br>
        →Question bank/quizzes</br>
        →Student feedback of the professors</br>
        →Lecture notes,E-books</br>
        →Discussions forums</p></br>

	 <h6><b>4.Conclusion</b></h6></br>
     <p>During the project we learned to apply different Interaction design methods and techniques.
	 We learned about field studies, how to carry out observation, how to conduct user research and 
	 make sure it is useful in the end solution. The analysis of data gathered by research was an interesting 
	 stage where many insights started to develop and we were able to picturize a solution in our head.Our next step will be to test 
	 the solution proposed till a satisfactory result is gathered about the system loopholes and usability of the interface.</p>
